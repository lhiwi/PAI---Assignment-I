This repository contains Python implementations of six classic algorithmic problems. 

**Problems Covered
Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)**: Implements a dynamic programming (O(n²)) approach to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in an array.
      
**Sudoku Solver**: It uses a backtracking algorithm to solve a partially filled 9x9 Sudoku board. The solution checks rows, columns, and 3x3 subgrids to ensure valid placements.
      
**N-Queens Problem**: Solves the N-Queens problem by placing N queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. The solution uses backtracking to generate all valid configurations.
      
**Word ladder**: Utilizes Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest transformation sequence from a start word to a target word, changing one letter at a time and ensuring each intermediate word exists in the provided dictionary.
      
**Find the Median of Two Sorted Arrays**:  Employs a binary search technique to efficiently find the median of two sorted arrays with a time complexity of O(log(min(n, m))).
      
**Graph Cycle Detection (Directed Graph)**:  It uses Depth-First Search (DFS) with a recursion stack to detect cycles in a directed graph.
