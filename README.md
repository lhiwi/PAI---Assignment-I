# PAI---Assignment-I
Algorithmic Assignment I
This repository contains human-friendly implementations of six classic algorithmic problems. Each solution is written in Python with detailed comments and clear variable names to enhance understanding and learning.

Problems Covered
Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)

Implements both a dynamic programming (O(n²)) approach and an optimized binary search method (O(n log n)) to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in an array.
Sudoku Solver

Uses a backtracking algorithm to solve a partially filled 9x9 Sudoku board. The solution checks rows, columns, and 3x3 subgrids to ensure valid placements.
N-Queens Problem

Solves the N-Queens problem by placing N queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. The solution uses backtracking to generate all valid configurations.
Word Ladder

Utilizes Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest transformation sequence from a start word to a target word, changing one letter at a time and ensuring each intermediate word exists in the provided dictionary.
Find Median of Two Sorted Arrays

Employs a binary search technique to efficiently find the median of two sorted arrays with a time complexity of O(log(min(n, m))).
Graph Cycle Detection (Directed Graph)

Uses Depth-First Search (DFS) along with a recursion stack to detect cycles in a directed graph.
